This repo contains a folder called 'PyCitySchools, which contains a jupyter notebook with the code necessary to perform analyses at the levels of district and school:
-District summary:
    -Total number of unique schools
    -Total students
    -Total budget
    -Average math score
    -Average reading score
    -% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    -% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    -% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

-School summary:
    -School name
    -School type
    -Total students
    -Total school budget
    -Per student budget
    -Average math score
    -Average reading score
    -% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    -% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    -% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

-Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    -Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
    -Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

-Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    -Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
    -Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

-Math Scores by Grade
    -Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for #students of each grade level (9th, 10th, #11th, 12th) at each school.

-Reading Scores by Grade
    -Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, #10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

-Scores by School Spending
    -Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
